This project is about building a reliable digital infrastructure that is able to support a shift in how people rent in Ghana.
We want to make sure people do not have to pay rent advance to landlords before can have access to rental accommodation. 
We want tenants to be able to pay their rent on flexible terms according to their income flow (monthly or weekly).
We are building  a web applicatio that is end-to-end encrypted from receiving application from a tenant to managing rent repayments.
The landing page talks about our services, offers, and all the necessary information everyone needs to know about the amazing thing we are doing.
The product features two dashboards, one for tenants to have a great flexible payments experience and one dashboard for the admin to make all the operations of the business.
